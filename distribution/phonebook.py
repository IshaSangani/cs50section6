# Write a program [phonebook.py](http://phonebook.py) that reads
# from a CSV file (provided as a command-line argument) using a DictReader and
# prints out the data on each person in the phone book.
# The file contains columns name and number, representing
# each person's name and phone number, respectively.

# As a next step, add some error checking to ensure that
# (1) the program is run with a command-line argument, and
# (2) the CSV file contains both a name column and a number column.
